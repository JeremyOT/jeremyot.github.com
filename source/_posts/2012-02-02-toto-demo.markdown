I've just posted a demo site for Toto at [http://jeremyot.com/Toto](http://jeremyot.com/Toto). It's a simple
relay-chat application with no backing store, so anything you post will be broadcast to anyone else viewing
the page and then lost. I built Toto to simplify web service development for a few projects that I've been
working on and it's proving to be quite useful. Check out the full source on [github](https://github.com/JeremyOT/Toto)
for more information.
